## ___A mininal but complete C17 `Win32` colorpicker desktop application___
------

- A shameless clone of the `Electron` based Colorpicker by @Toinane [Github](https://github.com/Toinane/colorpicker).
- All design credits goes to him. This is just a `Win32` C port of his application.
- Done primarily for learning Win32 GUI development as a hobby.
- A side intention was to find a efficient (less resource hungry) alternative to @Toinane's application. Albeit being beautifully designed and fully operational, it's an `Electron` app programmed in JS, so.. :(
- Implemented with the help of `Win32` bible `Programming Windows, 5th Edition` by `Charles Petzold`.
